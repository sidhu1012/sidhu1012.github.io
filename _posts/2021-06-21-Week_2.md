Key `highlights` of this weekâ€™s work are:

* **[Implement PinJoint and Joint class](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21564)**

  * Implemented the `_orient_frame()` to orient frames in arbitrary axes to align child
    and parent axes. Added proper tests for this functionality. Finally this PR seems almost done
    and is in review phase.
<br><br>
* **[Implement SlidingJoint](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21644)**

  * The `SlidingJoint` class is the practical implementation of a Pin Joint. This class inherits
    `Joint` class and forms KDEs, orient frames, set linear and angular velocities all by itself,
    according to the `SlidingJoint`.
    Implemented the entire class along with docstring and some unit tests.
