Key `highlights` of this weekâ€™s work are:

* **[JointsMethod](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21759)**

  * Added docstrings and an working example for `JointsMethod`.
    Made `JointsMethod` convert `Body` objects to `RigidBody` or `Particle`, as
    `KanesMethod` and `LagrangesMethod` doesn't work with `Body`.
