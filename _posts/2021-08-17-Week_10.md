Key `highlights` of this weekâ€™s work are:

* **[JointsMethod](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21759)**

  * Added 3D test case, `chaos pendulum` to check `JointsMethod` is working in all cases.
    Fixed all reviewed changes and got `JointsMethod` merged.
    This marks the completion of my GSoC projects.
