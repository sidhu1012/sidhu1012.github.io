Key `highlights` of this weekâ€™s work are:

* **[Implement PinJoint and Joint class](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21564)**

  * After doing hours of work and handling all the complicated corner cases, like
    when `parent_axis` and `child_axis` are oppposite to each other, finally got this
    PR merged!! PinJoint is ready to roll.
<br><br>

* **[Check order of arguments in orient_axis()](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21662)**

  * When we broke `orient()` to `orient_axis` , we by chance changed the order of arguments
    of angle and axis, since that change had been released we handled this case by changing arugments
    in source code if their types is correct, i.e if correct parameters are in wrong order.
<br><br>

* **[Add new features to class body](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21689)**

  * Since Body is general class for `Particle` and `RigidBody` , is synonymous to
    RefernceFrae and is to be used with `Joints` , `Body` class needed some functions from
    these classes for smooth functioning and less typing. I curently added the functions
    which I thought would be needed by the user again and again.
    Namely :- `maascenter_vel()`, `and_vel_in()`, `dcm()`.
<br><br>

* **[Add basis vector to body](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21700)**

  * Since Body is almost synonymous to ReferenceFrame, added the basis vector
    to class `Body`, so now vector with Body's frame can be generated from Body.
<br><br>

* **[Implement Sliding Joint](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21674)**

  * I had been working on SlidingJoint for a while, this week I cleaned the code,
    added tests for corner cases and completed the docstring with examples.
