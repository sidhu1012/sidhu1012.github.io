Key `highlights` of this weekâ€™s work are:

* **[Implement PinJoint and Joint class](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21564)**

  * There was one concept which I was missing in implementing Joints, and that was
    aligning axis before orienting frames. This week I tried to get some grip over physics
    topics and tried implementing the things I learnt.
<br><br>

* **[Adds `angle_between` to physics.Vector](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21600)**

  * Added a new function, `angle_between` to Vector class to calculate angle between two vectors,
    which was earlier needed to calculate manually using formula.
