Key `highlights` of this weekâ€™s work are:

* **[JointsMethod](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21759)**

  * Made `JointsMethod` work with both `KanesMethod` and `LagrangesMethod` and with all other future
    methods too if they are made according to previous methods. Also explicitly added `kinetic_energy`
    to class `Body` since compiler can't decide a Body object is a `RigidBody` or `Particle` because
    `Body` inherits both classes so introduced `is_particle` and `is_rigidbody` to `Body`, `Particle` and `RigidBody` so that they can be differentiated.
<br><br>

* **[Add new abstract base class for methods](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21778)**

  * Added a new class `_Methods`, which is to be inherited by `KanesMethod`, `LagrangesMethod` and
    other methods which would be made in future to make them similar to each other and make all
    methods to work with `JointsMethod`.
