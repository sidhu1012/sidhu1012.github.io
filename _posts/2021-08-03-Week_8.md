Key `highlights` of this weekâ€™s work are:

* **[JointsMethod](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21759)**

  * Made `KanesMethod` and `LagrangesMethod` alot similar than before by giving them similar properties
    so that we can use duck typing in `form_eoms` method function in `JointsMethod`.
    Extended the double pendulum test case.
