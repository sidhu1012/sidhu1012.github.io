Key `highlights` of this weekâ€™s work are:

* **[Implement PinJoint and Joint class](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21564)**

  * Corrected the assumptions, added extensive docstrings and tests.
<br><br>

* **[Implement SlidingJoint](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21674)**

  * Completed the implementation of SlidingJoint, tests and docstrings included.
<br><br>

* **[Check order of arguments in orient_axis()](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21662)**

  * The orient_axis() checks the order of it's arguments(axis and angle) and raises TypeError if order is incorrect because earlier the value of arguments being correct and order being correct the error message made it difficult to tracse back to a simple error.
