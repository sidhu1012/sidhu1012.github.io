The results of **[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6448685925269504)** were out on 17 May 2020 and I am pleased to share with you that my proposal with **[SymPy](http://sympy.org)** was accepted.

I would like to thank all the members of the organisation especially [Jason K. Moore](https://github.com/moorepants) for guiding me in my proposal and PR's. I am really excited to work for such an amazing organization.

I will be working on my project, [Implement JointsMethod](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dRPdFcJqk0BDDjNcaCvOSDaCo6BCkZV1c8HJYMIogKw), from May to August, under the mentorship of [[Jason K. Moore](https://github.com/moorepants) and [Nikhil Maan](https://github.com/Sc0rpi0n101).

My primary focus will be to work on the `physics/mechanics` module and implement a new method which would make solving a dynamics system simpler without the need of doing mathematics or forming/solving kinematical differential equations as all of this would be done by `JointsMethod` using`Kane's Method` ,all by itself.

Looking forward for a really productive and wonderful summer ahead.
